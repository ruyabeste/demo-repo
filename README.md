# Assignment #2 â€“ Git/GitHub

This file is created as part of Assignment #2 to document the process of using Git and GitHub. It includes the Git commands we used, the differences between working locally and on GitHub, the challenges faced, and how AI helped along the way.

## **1. Git Commands Used**

| Command                                           | Description                                                 |

## **2. Difference Between Local Git Workflow and GitHub Workflow**

- **Local Git Workflow**:

  - Changes are made on the local machine.
  - Commits are stored in a local repository.
  - No online collaboration unless pushed to a remote repository.

- **GitHub Workflow**:

  - Acts as a remote repository for backup and collaboration.
  - Allows multiple contributors to work on the same project.
  - Requires `git push` to update changes to the cloud.
  - `git pull` is used to sync changes from the remote repository to the local machine.

## **3. Difficulties Encountered**

During this process, some challenges were faced, including:

- **Git installation issues**, where the command was not recognized until properly set up.
- **SSH authentication problems**, which required generating and configuring SSH keys.
- **Locked files in VS Code**, preventing modifications to `coordinates.csv`.
- **Accidental duplicate data**, which had to be manually cleaned up.

---

## **4. When I Decided to Make a Commit**

I decided to make commits at important stages to keep track of progress and avoid losing work:

- After setting up the Git repository.
- After adding new locations to the `coordinates.csv` file.
- After fixing errors, like duplicated entries.
- Whenever I made significant changes that needed to be saved.

## **5. AI Assistance & Benefits**

AI was really helpful in this project, especially for:

- **Debugging Git errors** and finding solutions quickly.
- **Providing correct Git commands** when I was unsure about the syntax.
- **Helping with this README.md file**, making it more structured and clear.
