ðŸ“Œ Some examples of commands I used in this assignment :
- **The command updates the README.md file by staging the changes, committing them with a message, and pushing them to the main branch on GitHub**.

- **The git pull origin main command is used to fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository's main branch into the local repository**.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Get-Content <file>`      | Displays the contents of a file                  |
| `Set-Content <file>`      | Overwrites the content of a file                 |
| `Add-Content <file>`      | Appends content to a file                        |

ðŸ“Œ Some examples of commands I used in this assignment : 
- **The command Add-Content coordinates.csv was used to append a new location entry to the coordinates.csv file without overwriting its existing content**.

## **2. Difference Between Local Git Workflow and GitHub Workflow**

- **Local Git Workflow**:

  - Changes are made on the local machine.
  - Commits are stored in a local repository.
  - No online collaboration unless pushed to a remote repository.

- **GitHub Workflow**:

  - Acts as a remote repository for backup and collaboration.
  - Allows multiple contributors to work on the same project.
  - Requires `git push` to update changes to the cloud.
  - `git pull` is used to sync changes from the remote repository to the local machine.

## **3. Difficulties Encountered**

During this process, some challenges were faced, including:

- **Git installation issues**, where the command was not recognized until properly set up.
- **SSH authentication problems**, which required generating and configuring SSH keys.
- **Locked files in VS Code**, preventing modifications to `coordinates.csv`.
- **Accidental duplicate data**, which had to be manually cleaned up.

### **ðŸ›‘ Some Errors I Encountered**
Below are some errors I encountered during this assignment along with their solutions.

ðŸ“Œ **Screenshot of the error:**
![Git not recognized error](img/git_not_recognized.png)

- **Reason:** Git is installed but **not added to the system PATH**.
- **Solution:**
  - **Check if Git is installed:**
    ```powershell
    git --version
    ```
  - If the command is not recognized:
    1. **Reinstall Git.** ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
    2. **Restart your computer.**
    3. **Run the command again.**
    4. If the issue persists, **manually add Git's installation directory to the system PATH**.

ðŸ“Œ **Screenshot of the error:**
![Git not recognized error](img/git_permission_denied.png)
- **Reason:** SSH keys are either not configured or **not properly added to GitHub**.
- **Solution:**
  - **Check if an SSH key exists:**
  ```powershell
  ls ~/.ssh
  ```
  - If no SSH key is present, generate one using:
  ```powershell
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
  ```
  - Add the SSH key to GitHub:
    1. Copy the SSH key:
    ```powershell
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```
    2. Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys â†’ Add a new SSH key.
    3. Paste the copied key and save.
    Now you can test the SSH connection:
    ```powershell
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

## **4. When I Decided to Make a Commit**

I decided to make commits at important stages to keep track of progress and avoid losing work:

- After setting up the Git repository.
- After adding new locations to the `coordinates.csv` file.
- After fixing errors, like duplicated entries.
- Whenever I made significant changes that needed to be saved.

## **5. AI Assistance & Benefits**

AI was really helpful in this project, especially for:

- **Debugging Git errors** and finding solutions quickly.
- **Providing correct Git commands** when I was unsure about the syntax.
- **Helping with this README.md file**, making it more structured and clear.
